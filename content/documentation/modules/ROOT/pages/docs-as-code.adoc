= Docs-As-Code

Docs-as-code can have many meanings. I include:

* Source control
* Automated testing
* Peer reviews
* Enforcing a style-guide
* Collecting and responding to reader feedback

I think that most of the above is well understood, however, the area that I think that needs to be improved in general is automated
testing. Here is a breakdown of what I think automated testing is:

* Doc test builds
* Link checking
* Style-guide enforcement
* Code-sample testing

I don't think that code-sample testing is widely adopted. I believe that most organizations fall in the "test when someone complains"
camp.

=== Overview

A year or two ago I saw a GitHub issue related to a bug in some documentation
that I wrote. Later in the same week I saw another issue about a different page
in the docs. Both of these issues were related to key features that the
community and customers were using in production.

After retesting the steps in the docs and confirming that the issues were
accurate I looked through the release notes and found the related breaking
changes.

Waiting for the community and customers to find the bugs in the docs or bugs in
the code is a common problem, and it is embarrassing.

The best way to know when software changes is to run tests against every code
change. This is common for code changes, but somehow the code changes and sample
data used in the tests don't make their way into the documentation.

=== The fix

* Treat the docs as code.
* As end to end docs (tutorials, quick starts, how-to guides) are designed, they
should be written as test plans.
* Automate the test plan.
* Write the doc, but instead of copy/pasting the code snippets (SQL in my case)
into the docs, import the snippets directly from the automated test.
* Run the test suite on a regular basis.
* As tests fail, get the code fixed if the failure indicates a bug, or update the
test to include the new behavior of the system. The update to the test should cause
an update to the documentation, as the doc system is pulling the code snippets
from the tests.

=== Example

A recent feature of the project I am working on queries data in files stored in object
storage, figures out the schema of the data, then creates and populates a table in a
database.

The SQL that causes this magic to happen looks like this:

.Create table from S3 using FILES() table function
[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE DocsQA.user_behavior_inferred
AS SELECT * FROM FILES (
	"path" = "s3://starrocks-examples/user_behavior_ten_million_rows.parquet",
	"format" = "parquet",
	"aws.s3.region" = "us-east-1",
	"aws.s3.access_key" = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
	"aws.s3.secret_key" = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
);
----

Yesterday I would have copied the above out of the SQL client I used to run
the query and pasted it into a Markdown file. But today, I would instead use
this syntax to grab the above from the test specification like so:

[,markdown]
----
```
sql reference title="Create table from S3 using FILES() table function"
https://github.com/DanRoscigno/docs/blob/6d6fcf905162adf80bd094cb9dd133a5c557bdd3/SQL/files_table_fxn.sql#L1-L11
```
----

NOTE: This is `docusaurus-theme-github-codeblock` syntax, not Asciidoc. With Asciidoc I would include content by
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include-tagged-regions/[tagged regions^,target="_blank"]. Similarly, with Restructured Text I would us remote code blocks with https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer/blob/main/src/documenteer/ext/remotecodeblock.py#L43[`start-after` and `end-before`].

In Docusaurus this renders as:

image::shared:testSQL.png[Create table from S3]

=== Proof of concept

An implementation of the above is described at
https://github.com/DanRoscigno/SingleSourceCodeTestingAndDocs/blob/main/README.md[Single-sourcing docs from code^,target="_blank"].

== Reader feedback

Collecting reader feedback is important. Many of the feedback widgets available rely on systems that are blocked by
browser ad blockers. I am using a React component that collects feedback and writes to PostHog and does not rely on
cookies. Each week a
https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/blob/main/.github/workflows/weekly-docs-feedback.yml[scheduled GitHub workflow^,target="_blank"]
collects the feedback from PostHog and generates an issue with the reader feedback. The same workflow queries Algolia
for the top successful searches and failed searches in the docs. This informs the documentation team and
product management on which features or commands are important to readers.

== CI checks

Link checking, Markdown linting, and build tests are performed on each commit to documentation pull requests by the https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-doc-checker.yml#L62-L135[doc CI job^,target="_blank"].
